\chapter{Description of problem}

The usage of the human hands as interaction devices has been a topic of research and most solution concentrate on the tracking of the human hand itsself. Most solutions only did rudimentary integration testing of their developed systems with an VR application.Some of the Solutions are even not capable of tracking the hands in real time.

This thesis will focus on building an Tracking solution for tracking  a physical object and the human hand in "real" space. The tracking data is then used in the "virtual" Space to diplay these two objects correctly and allow the user to get a physical feedback when grabbing the real object in the virtual world.\\
\\
Therefore it will first give an Overview of how the human hand can be displayed in the digital realm. furtermore it will give an overview of the possible Tracking algorithms with ttheir pros and cons.
In the next step an testing setuo for evaluation will be described.
