 abstract = {The purpose of this project is to create a library that will allow its users to control 3D applications by using one or both of their hands. The final product could easily be incorporated into 3D applications, each customized to utilize a set of poses. Even though off-the-shelf motion capture gloves have reached lower prices in recent years, they are still expensive for home users. The algorithm suggested is based only on a single webcam combined with coded palm and fingers. Users should be able to code one or more of the fingers. One webcam is still somewhat constraining as two should ideally be used for 3D mapping of the hand, but by additionally using palm and finger coding we can greatly improve precision and, most importantly, reduce the processing power required for feasible real-time 3D interaction.},

@inproceedings{Fredriksson.2008,
 abstract = {This paper presents a low-cost method for enabling 3D handcomputer interaction. The method, accompanied by a system, uses the frame capturing functionality of a single consumer-grade webcam. Our recent work has been focused on examining and realizing a less complex system. The presented method reduces the tracking effort to only one reference marker: a color-coded bracelet that helps locate the part of the captured frame containing the user's hand. The located area contains all the information needed to extract hand rotation and finger angle data. To facilitate hand feature extraction, we have outfitted the user's hand with a specially coded glove. The glove is equipped with two square palm markers, a marker on either side of the hand, and five distinctly shaded finger sheaths. We believe that an approach that only tracks only one marker will be more efficient than similar methods that track each finger separately. The method is further simplified by using spatial properties, drawn from physiological characteristics of the human hand, to limit the areas considered by the algorithm. Some challenges regarding webcam limitations may arise when attempting to carry this method into effect, including problems related to image noise and limited image- and color-resolution. Overlapping hands and fingers, hand positioning outside the field of view, and interference by local light sources are other exigent factors to consider.},

@incollection{Kristensen.Feb.2007,
 abstract = {To efficiently classify and track video objects in a surveillance application, it is essential to reduce the amount of streaming data. One solution is to segment the video into background, i.e. stationary objects, and foreground, i.e. moving objects, and then discard the background. One such motion segmentation algorithm that has proven reliable is the Stauffer and Grimson algorithm. This paper investigates how different color spaces affect the segmentation result in terms of noise and shadow sensitivity. Shadows are especially problematic since they not only distort shape but can also result in falsely connected objects that will complicate tracking and classification. Therefore, a new decision kernel for the segmentation algorithm is presented. This kernel alters the probability of foreground detection to reduce shadows and to increase the chance of correct segmentation for objects with a skin tone color, e.g. faces.},

@inproceedings{LaGorce.2008,
 abstract = {A novel model-based approach to 3D hand tracking from monocular video is presented. The 3D hand pose, the hand texture and the illuminant are dynamically estimated through minimization of an objective function. Derived from an inverse problem formulation, the objective function enables explicit use oftexture temporal continuity and shading information, while handling important self-occlusions and time-varying illumination. The minimization is done efficiently using a quasi-Newton method, for which we propose a rigorous derivation of the objective function gradient. Particular attention is given to terms related to the change of visibility near self-occlusion boundaries that are neglected in existing formulations. In doing so we introduce new occlusion forces and show that using all gradient terms greatly improves the performance of the method. Experimental results demonstrate the potential ofthe formulation.},

@inproceedings{Lin.2000,
 abstract = {Hand motion capturing is one of the most important parts of gesture interfaces. Many current approaches to this task generally involve a formidable nonlinear optimization problem in a large search space. Motion capturing can be achieved more cost-efficiently when considering the motion constraints of a hand. Although some constraints can be represented as equalities or inequalities, there exist many constraints, which cannot be explicitly represented. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to model the hand configuration space directly. The redundancy of the configuration space can be eliminated by finding a lower-dimensional subspace of the original space. Finger motion is modeled in this subspace based on the linear behavior observed in the real motion data collected by a CyberGlove. Employing the constrained motion model, we are able to efficiently capture finger motion from video inputs. Several experiments show that our proposed model is helpful for capturing articulated motion.},

How- ever, when we work with a computer or computer-controlled ap- plication, we are constrained by clumsy intermediary devices such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks. Little of the dexterity and nat- uralness that characterize our hands transfers to the task itself. In an effort to change this, people have been designing, build- ing, and studying ways of getting computers to ``read'' users' hands directly, free from the limitations of intermediary de- vices. The development of electronic gloves has been an im- portant step in this direction. The commercialization and widespread availability of devices such as the VPL DataGlove and the Matte1 Power Glove has led to an explosion of research and development projects using electronic gloves as interfaces to computer applications and computer-controlled devices. The applications span fields as diverse as telemanipulation, virtual reality, medicine, scientific visualization, puppetry, music, and video games. In this article we provide a basis for understanding the field by describing key hand-tracking technologies and applications using glove-based input. The bulk of development in glove- based input has taken place very recently, and not all of it is easily accessible in the literature. We present here a cross-sec- tion of the field to date.},

 abstract = {The Leap Motion Controller is a new device for hand gesture controlled user interfaces with declared sub-millimeter accuracy. However, up to this point its capabilities in real environments have not been analyzed. Therefore, this paper presents a first study of a Leap Motion Controller. The main focus of attention is on the evaluation of the accuracy and repeatability. For an appropriate evaluation, a novel experimental setup was developed making use of an industrial robot with a reference pen allowing a position accuracy of 0.2 mm. Thereby, a deviation between a desired 3D position and the average measured positions below 0.2 mm has been obtained for static setups and of 1.2 mm for dynamic setups. Using the conclusion of this analysis can improve the development of applications for the Leap Motion controller in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.},
