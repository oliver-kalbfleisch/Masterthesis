\begin{abstract}
Professional-grade hand and object racking systems are usually the result of long years of combining specialized hardware and software components to achieve a tracing solution. This comes at the cost of a high technical complexity of the systems and a corresponding high pricepoint. The underlying technical concepts of these systems can be boiled down to rather simple concepts. Therefore this paper will evaluate if it is possible to build a hand and object tracking system on low cost consumer grade hardware components. Therefor the most most common approach to spatial tracking, a stereoscopic camera setup, is chosen as the system base. To keep system cost low, a set of Raspberry Pi's with the matching Camera is used for image acquiring an processing. These processing units are linked to a master unit which takes care of stereoscopic depth calculations, the position value processing and the final rendering of a hand and object model in digital space. Several colored markers are assessed for the prototype application and compared in terms of tracking precision. A relatively new inverse kinematic framework as well as a novel method for input value filtering is also applied  and evaluated in the process.
The final results show that it is possible to achieve a tracking system solution with the used hardware components that has a suitable tracking update frequency and precision. The resulting prototype is good base for further research in terms of processing optimization.
